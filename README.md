## How It Works

JackpotSol operates as a decentralized lottery pool where users purchase tickets, and a random winner is selected from the participants. Hereâ€™s how it all works:

1. **Ticket Purchase**: Users buy tickets for a chance to win the jackpot. The cost of each ticket is predefined by the lottery parameters.
2. **Prize Pool Accumulation**: Ticket sales automatically contribute to the prize pool.
3. **Random Winner Selection**: At the end of the lottery period, the smart contract randomly selects a winner.
4. **Prize Distribution**: The prize is transferred automatically to the winner's wallet.
